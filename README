some mason bricks that we use for our internal workflow

> Note that we use `bdaya_flutter_common` as a base library for the generated code

* bdaya_form
    - generate a form using `reactive_forms_annotations` + `reactive_forms_generator`
* bdaya_page
    - generate a simple page (view + controller)
* bdaya_route 
    - generate a page that reacts to route changes from `go_router`


## Usage

`mason make bdaya_form -o lib/src/dialogs --name EditUser`
`mason make bdaya_route -o lib/src/pages --name UserDetails`
`mason make bdaya_page -o lib/src/pages --name Users`

> Note that `bdaya_form` requires `build_runner` and these dependencies:
>
> `dart pub add reactive_forms_annotations --dev build_runner --dev reactive_forms_generator`
